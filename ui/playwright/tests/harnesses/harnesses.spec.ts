/**
 * Harnesses, on the fixtures. The tab offers create and delete and no edit, and that
 * journey runs against both backends from `shared/harnesses/`. What stays is the reading
 * — the seeded rows, the selector on the page, the narrowing — and the two refusals
 * below, which are the form enforcing the cluster's constraints rather than creating
 * anything.
 *
 * **The admission selector has to be visible.** A harness admits templates through a
 * label selector, and that selector decides whether a template ever becomes an agent at
 * all. One carrying no label it matches saves happily and then does nothing, with nothing
 * on screen explaining why.
 *
 * **A harness must not be called broken.** `ready: false` also covers one the controller
 * has not observed yet, which is a different thing from one that failed — the `kagent`
 * harness on a development cluster runs agents and carries `status: null`.
 *
 * **The form is short because the CRD is strict**: exactly one runtime adapter, an image
 * pinned by digest, and a worker pool to schedule onto. A form that accepted a tag would
 * build a resource the cluster rejects, which is why the fixture refuses it too.
