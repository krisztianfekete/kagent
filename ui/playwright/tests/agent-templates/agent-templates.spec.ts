/**
 * Agent templates, on the fixtures. Creating, editing and removing one runs against both
 * backends from `shared/agent-templates/`; what is left is the reading — the seeded rows,
 * the narrowing, the sorting — the form's refusal of an unusable template, both branches
 * of the delete warning, and the empty and failure states. The create below is setup
 * rather than a claim; see the note on `CREATED`.
 *
 * **The property this spec exists for: a template no harness admits cannot be used, and
 * nothing about it looks wrong.** A harness admits through a label selector, so a template
 * whose labels match nothing reaches no prepared revision and every `CreateAgentInstance`
 * naming it is refused — while still having a model, a prompt, and a row in this list.
 * Confirmed against a cluster before any of this was built: an unlabelled template sat at
 * `status: {observedGeneration: 1}` with no harnesses at all, and adding the one label its
 * harness selects on took it to a ready golden snapshot in about ten seconds. So the "Runs
 * on" column, the warning in the form and the button that applies a harness's labels are
 * the feature rather than decoration.
 *
 * **Reading a template is not the same act as changing one.** A row opens a details page
 * with editing as a mode rather than a page of inputs with Save waiting, and both states
 * are asserted on the same component, since a separate read-only view is what would drift.
