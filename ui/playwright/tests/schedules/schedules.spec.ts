 * Schedules — reading one, running it, and the states around that.
 *
 * The write journey runs against both backends from `shared/schedules/`, and the claim
 * that a schedule survives a reload — which the fixtures structurally cannot answer,
 * keeping writes in the page's own memory — is `live/schedules.spec.ts`. That same
 * memory is why the steps below click through rather than navigate wherever a write has
 * to outlive the step that made it.
 *
 * **A schedule is the only resource here that runs**, so pausing one, invoking it by hand
 * while paused, and reading the execution it produced are covered here and nowhere else.
 *
 * **Its cadence has two representations.** An advanced cron expression the repeat picker
 * cannot show has to survive an edit to some other field — the case that silently
 * destroys a reader's work.
 *
 * **Its history outlives it.** A deleted schedule still opens by address and says what it
 * is, so that address is neither a 404 nor a live schedule.
 *
 * Five selectors read prose deliberately: two are fixture data in a cell with no id to
 * give it, one is a form rule's message, and two are `getByLabel` on the weekday
 * checkboxes, which are genuinely labelled controls.
