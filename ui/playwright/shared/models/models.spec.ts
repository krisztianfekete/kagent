 * wrapped one way in the fixtures and another by the API, a name sent where a ref
 * belonged. The fixtures answer whatever they were taught, so only a cluster can
 * settle it — and only this spec asks both the same question.
 *
 * What stays in `tests/models/models.spec.ts` is what needs the fixtures: the exact
 * seeded rows, the required-field marks, the refresh count, and the empty and failure
