 * merely long. A lifecycle is a dozen steps and four round trips through forms, so
 * the default says nothing about its health there — only about its length.
 *
 * **By shape, not by folder.** Any one test of ten or more steps needs it, wherever it

 * left `chat/questions.spec.ts` with twelve steps on the default, which is what timed
 * out in CI at step eight while passing twenty times in isolation.
 *
 * Sixty rather than ninety, and the difference is the point: loose enough for a
 * contended run, tight enough that a journey which doubles in cost is still a
 * failure. The slowest is prompts at about forty seconds under full parallel load,
 * its list fanning out one call per namespace.
 *
 * **Live is a different budget, not a slower version of the same one.** Against a
 * cluster every step is a round trip to an API server and some of them wait on a
 * controller to reconcile, which is work no mock does at all — the config already
 * doubles the per-test default for that reason, and a `describe.configure` overrides
 * it, so a lifecycle asking for sixty here would have been the tightest budget in the
