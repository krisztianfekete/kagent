/**
 * Every page, against a real controller.
 *
 * The mock suite already asserts each page's loading, empty and failure states,
 * which it can because it can ask the mock backend for them. A real cluster cannot
 * be asked for a 500, so this spec asserts the thing the mock suite structurally
 * cannot: that the pages work against what a controller actually sends.
 *
 * That has not been a formality on this project. Every defect found by pointing the
 * app at a real backend was a place where a fixture had taught a shape the
 * controller does not use — a null collection where an array was declared, a create
 * response wrapped one way in the fixtures and another by the API, a resource name
 * sent where a bare name belonged. None of them were visible to a green mock suite.

 * failed a second later passed with it. Demonstrated by delaying one read and then
 * failing it — the guard saw nothing and the alert arrived after the step had moved on.
 *
 * The failure states are in here beside the good ones deliberately. Gated on success
 * alone this waits out sixty seconds and reports "no summary", where what happened is on
 * screen and has a message on it: `expectNoLoadFailure` reads it out instead.

 * for a read that succeeded — zero rows included — and nothing at all while one is in
