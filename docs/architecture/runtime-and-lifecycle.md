# Runtime and Lifecycle

An `Session` is PostgreSQL-backed control-plane state exposed through gRPC.
It pins one prepared revision and names one Substrate Actor. It is not a
Kubernetes resource.

## Creation and state

Creation selects the latest successful revision for the Agent, creates a deterministic Actor initially suspended, and marks the session
ready after Substrate accepts it. Readiness of the image was already established
while preparing the ate-api ActorTemplate; Session creation does not resume
an Actor merely to probe `/readyz`.

Create (including forks), explicit Suspend, Resume, and Delete keep their current
operation UUID and executor claim on the session row. Fork creation loads its
pinned checkpoint from PostgreSQL. Namespace provisioning belongs to the Agent
controller; session creation uses the pinned ActorTemplate's existing namespace.
Read-only preparation may run concurrently, but an atomic execution claim permits
one bounded inline attempt to issue runtime mutations. Network work holds no database
transaction or lock. Completion changes the session atomically and retains its
operation UUID until a later transition supersedes it.

A joined caller observes the current session only while its admitted generation
remains current. A superseded caller gets a conflict and issues no runtime work,
even when the new operation has the same state and kind. There is no historical
lifecycle result archive or pruning requirement. Creation retries return current
session state; already-at-target Suspend/Resume requests are successful no-ops.
Neither requires an old operation receipt. A2A task storage and checkpoint
reconstruction have their own durable history requirements.

An unclaimed operation can retry preparation; Delete may supersede it. Preparation
failure invalidates its generation. After an attempt issues runtime work, errors
retain the operation and resource pins. The attempt releases its execution claim
on return. A crashed executor's claim expires after at most two minutes, allowing
a client retry to claim the same operation with a new executor ID. Each attempt
uses a context bounded by that interval; no claim renewer or recovery sweep runs.
A stale executor cannot complete or release a newer attempt's claim.

Lifecycle retries inspect the pinned Actor identity and continue Substrate's
reentrant workflows, including completing egress setup for an existing creation.
Already completed creation steps are not repeated. Fork retries must still match
the retained source snapshot. Conflicting Session lifecycle, task, and checkpoint
work remains blocked until the pending operation completes. Releasing an attempt
never clears its durable intent or makes uncertain work an unissued preparation.

Clients must retry the mutation after transient errors; Get only observes it.
If the client stops retrying, the explicit operation remains pending across API
restarts. There is no general automatic lifecycle recovery. The
[client retry contract](../lifecycle-retries.md) covers error codes, deadlines,
creation request IDs, and the limitations of retries and concurrent callers.

Deletion retains an indefinitely kept DELETED session tombstone with its owner,
creation request identity, and final operation UUID. It clears runtime routing,
releases the revision and checkpoint pins, and revokes shares atomically. A fork's
source checkpoint UUID remains as request identity; a generated foreign-key column
pins that checkpoint only while the session is live. Ordinary session/task/share
access excludes deleted sessions. Create/Fork request IDs remain reserved after
deletion and cannot recreate compute. Public Delete still returns NotFound for a
fresh request after deletion; already-authorized joined Delete callers can observe
the final tombstone. No public operation API is introduced.

Explicit suspend and resume update the logical lifecycle state. Deletion closes task
admission, stops and deletes the Actor, then tombstones the session. The workflow
entry points are in
[`go/core/internal/service/session`](../../go/core/internal/service/session).
TaskStore writes and automatic idle lifecycle work use durable task boundaries
alongside these explicit lifecycle claims. Checkpoint reservations also block
conflicting task writes and idle lifecycle work.

The unreleased schema requires a clean database. Do not overlap older binaries that
can issue lifecycle calls without session-local execution claims. PostgreSQL tests with controlled
Actor responses verify claim ordering, delayed callers, and lost responses; live
Substrate settlement and the complete multi-replica rollout remain acceptance work.

## Automatic quiescence

The runtime stages a final task update and acknowledges it after native cleanup.
That acknowledgement publishes task state and history atomically, without waiting
for pause/suspend. A Session lifecycle worker independently claims the idle
boundary in PostgreSQL. INPUT_REQUIRED/AUTH_REQUIRED pauses the actor on its node;
terminal work suspends it and records the exact external snapshot. Waiting tasks
are not forkable. The Session stays logically READY, and Substrate ingress
resumes it when another authorized interaction arrives.

Unfinished native cleanup blocks new task writes and explicit lifecycle changes.
After publication, a new turn may supersede idle work before it is claimed. Once
claimed, idle work blocks new execution, explicit lifecycle changes, and checkpoint
capture until its outcome is recorded. The worker performs runtime I/O outside the
database transaction. Successful snapshot references are retried on database failure
without repeating the Substrate operation. Checkpoint creation requires the matching
snapshot and can return FailedPrecondition after task completion while it is pending.

Unclaimed idle work survives API restarts. A claim for possibly issued runtime work
never expires: losing the worker does not prove that the suspend stopped. Uncertain
claims still block new work, but completed results remain readable. The recorded
actor UID is checked before lifecycle calls; a same-name replacement cannot be
adopted implicitly.

## Runtime boundaries

- Port `8083` serves native gRPC, gRPC-Web, A2A, authenticated MCP, and health.
- Actor A2A gRPC is private on port `80`.
- Runtime readiness is private HTTP `/readyz` on port `8081`.
- ate-api defaults to `dns:///api.ate-system.svc:443`.

Clients never receive Actor addresses. The gateway derives and dials them through
the private atenetwork router.

Every Actor mounts a Substrate `DurableDir` at `/data`. Harnesses keep private
state there—local framework state, workspaces, and downloaded assets that must
survive Actor replacement. This state is runtime-private; public task history
remains in PostgreSQL.
