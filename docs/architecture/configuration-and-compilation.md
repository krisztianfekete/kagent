# Configuration and Compilation

## Public configuration

`Harness` describes how to run a class of agents. It selects exactly one runtime
variant—kagent, Codex, Claude, or BYO—and contains workload image/command/args,
environment and credential references, WorkerPool configuration, snapshot
location, and an admission selector.

`AgentTemplate` describes what the agent does. It contains model configuration,
description and prompt, MCP tool bindings, skills, plugins, and Shared or
Dedicated agent bindings. Model configuration may be omitted for BYO images;
pair compilation rejects managed harness combinations without one.

Both are `kagent.dev/v1alpha3` Kubernetes resources. Infrastructure-derived
values such as runtime addresses and inferred egress do not belong in the public
API.

### kagent workload overrides

The kagent compiler preserves explicit `spec.workload.command` and
`spec.workload.args` in the runtime revision and generated ActorTemplate,
regardless of the runtime image's implementation language. Omitted overrides
remain unset.

For example, this Harness excerpt selects debug logging for the Go ADK image
without changing the AgentTemplate:

```yaml
spec:
  kagent: {}
  workload:
    # Retain the digest-pinned Go ADK image here.
    command: ["/app"]
    args: ["--log-level", "debug"]
```

Command and argument changes participate in revision identity. They affect newly
prepared revisions, not existing AgentInstances pinned to an older revision.

## Prepared revision pipeline

The v2 controller collects admitted Harness/AgentTemplate pairs and compiles each
pair through one pipeline:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    H[Harness] --> MATCH{admission selector matches}
    AT[AgentTemplate] --> MATCH
    MATCH --> RESOLVE[resolve template tree and references]
    RESOLVE --> INPUTS[build explicit inputs]
    INPUTS --> REGISTRY{runtime type}
    REGISTRY --> K[kagent compiler]
    REGISTRY --> X[Codex compiler]
    REGISTRY --> C[Claude compiler]
    REGISTRY --> B[BYO compiler]
    K --> POOL[resolve WorkerPool sandbox class]
    X --> POOL
    C --> POOL
    B --> POOL
    POOL --> REV[immutable revision and digest]
    POOL -->|error| STATUS
    REV --> ATE[ate-api ActorTemplate]
    ATE --> GOLDEN[golden snapshot]
    GOLDEN -->|ready| LATEST[latest successful revision]
    RESOLVE -->|error| STATUS[pair status]
    ATE -->|error| STATUS
```

1. Resolve the template tree and referenced Kubernetes objects.
2. Build explicit, harness-independent inputs.
3. Select the harness compiler from the runtime-type registration map.
4. Produce an immutable revision containing workload, configuration, Agent Card,
   capacity, snapshot, provenance, and inferred egress inputs.
5. Resolve the Harness's WorkerPool sandbox class, hash the revision, and apply
   it as an ate-api ActorTemplate.
6. Wait for the golden snapshot to become ready.
7. Persist the revision and advance the pair's latest-successful pointer.

A failed compile or apply leaves the previous successful revision available.
AgentInstances pin a prepared revision, so later template edits do not mutate a
running instance.

Harness compilers only translate inputs. The controller and Substrate adapter own
application and readiness. The central entry points are
[`translator/compiler.go`](../../go/core/internal/translator/compiler.go) and
[`controller/reconciler.go`](../../go/core/internal/controller/reconciler.go).

Reconciliation and runtime-observation collections compare ActorTemplates and
nested revision Agent Cards with protobuf semantic equality. Lazy protobuf
reflection and size caches are not state changes and must not be inspected by
KRT's reflection-based comparison. Other fields retain their existing equality
semantics.

### WorkerPool sandbox selection

For every harness type, the controller resolves `spec.substrate.workerPoolRef`
in the Harness/AgentTemplate namespace. The pool's `spec.sandboxClass` selects
the ActorTemplate's sandbox configuration:

| WorkerPool class | ActorTemplate sandbox class | SandboxConfig name |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Empty or `gvisor` | `SANDBOX_CLASS_GVISOR` | `gvisor-default` |
| `microvm` | `SANDBOX_CLASS_MICROVM` | `microvm` |

These names follow Substrate v0.2.0-beta5's standard gVisor installation and
MicroVM setup/E2E convention. They are not API-level defaults or discovery:
Substrate requires an explicit name and rejects a missing SandboxConfig or a
class mismatch. Operators must install the corresponding cluster-scoped
SandboxConfig and provision compatible workers and runtime assets. Selecting
`microvm` does not install those prerequisites or configure a Kubernetes
RuntimeClass.

A missing WorkerPool reports `WorkerPoolNotFound`; an unsupported class reports
`RevisionInvalid`. Neither produces a desired ActorTemplate. The worker-pool
selector is unchanged. WorkerPool updates are tracked through KRT and recompute
the desired revision. Empty and explicit `gvisor` preserve the previous digest
byte-for-byte; `microvm` participates in the digest, so its prepared runtime
cannot be confused with a gVisor revision. Returning to gVisor restores the
original digest. Existing AgentInstances remain pinned to their revisions.

Unresolved inputs still replace the persisted desired pointer with the requested
identity shown in status, without creating a runtime revision. This releases
abandoned preparations for garbage collection while preserving the current
pair's last-successful runtime.

Substrate and persistence failures during preparation report
`Ready=False` with reason `RuntimePreparationFailed`, rather than remaining
silently pending. Status includes a safe error code; a failed precondition also
names the expected SandboxConfig and class. Raw backend error messages are not
copied into Kubernetes status. Preparation keeps retrying and clears the failure
after the prerequisite or service recovers; terminal compilation, immutable
template conflict, and golden-snapshot failures are not retried by that poll.

This selection does not by itself guarantee full MicroVM lifecycle or
cross-node restore compatibility; those also depend on Substrate, runtime
images, and compatible worker hardware.

## Harness-specific output

- **kagent** emits Go ADK configuration, the Harness's memory and context
  compaction policy, Shared native subagents, and the kagent HITL extension.
- **Codex** emits native App Server configuration, OpenAI or Bedrock model setup,
  Streamable HTTP MCP servers, Shared agents, and skills. Approvals are currently
  disabled by policy.
- **Claude** emits Anthropic, Bedrock, or Vertex model setup, HTTP/SSE MCP
  servers, Shared agents, and skills.
- **BYO** runs a digest-pinned user image that implements private A2A gRPC and
  `/readyz`. Optional model, prompt, tool, skill, and plugin configuration is
  supplied in the ADK-shaped format when requested.

Dedicated agent bindings are not compiled yet.

`spec.kagent.compaction` on the Harness is runtime policy, like `spec.kagent.memory`:
it belongs to the runner that drives the root agent and is not part of the
portable template. The kagent compiler applies it to every root agent the
Harness runs. A summarizer `ModelConfig` other than the agent's own is resolved
from the Harness namespace like the memory model and joins the revision's
credentials, egress, and provenance.
