# Public A2A transports

The core gateway serves A2A over gRPC and HTTP/JSON-RPC on the controller's API
listener (port 8083 by default). Both transports use the same AgentInstance
authorization, durable tasks, history, and runtime lifecycle.

Each AgentInstance has a discoverable HTTP endpoint:

| Operation | Path |
| --- | --- |
| Read the Agent Card | `GET /agents/{instance-id}/.well-known/agent-card.json` |
| Call JSON-RPC, including streaming | `POST /agents/{instance-id}` |

The URL selects the instance. HTTP clients do not need the
`x-kagent-agent-instance-id` header; supplying it cannot override the URL.
gRPC clients continue to supply that header on the existing A2A service.
There is no deployment-wide Agent Card because the gateway serves multiple agents.

Cards and JSON-RPC calls require the same authentication as the core API. A
validated `X-Share-Token` supplements the authenticated user's access to its
instance: read-only shares permit card/task reads and subscriptions; read-write
shares also permit messages and cancellation. Cards are not publicly cached.

The card comes from the instance's pinned template revision and advertises
JSON-RPC first, followed by gRPC. It retains runtime extensions while reporting
the gateway's streaming capabilities. JSON-RPC uses the pinned upstream A2A v1
SDK and supports `SendMessage`, `SendStreamingMessage`, `GetTask`, `ListTasks`,
`CancelTask`, `SubscribeToTask`, and `GetExtendedAgentCard`. These are the v1
method names for the operations older clients called `message/send`,
`message/stream`, `tasks/get`, `tasks/list`, `tasks/cancel`, and
`tasks/resubscribe`.

Set `controller.a2aGatewayUrl` in Helm (the controller's `KAGENT_GATEWAY_URL`) to
the externally reachable gateway base URL when exposing agents outside the
cluster. Its default is the controller's cluster Service URL. HTTP interfaces
append `/agents/{instance-id}` to this base, preserving any deployment prefix.
An ingress using a prefix must strip that prefix before forwarding to the core
listener. Forward streaming responses without buffering.

For example, with the default unsecure authentication mode:

```sh
curl -H 'X-User-Id: alice' \
  'https://kagent.example/agents/INSTANCE_ID/.well-known/agent-card.json'
```

Use the returned JSON-RPC interface URL with an A2A v1 client, supplying the
credentials required by the deployment on discovery and subsequent requests.
